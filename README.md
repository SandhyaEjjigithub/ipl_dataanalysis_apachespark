**Apache Spark:**

Apache Spark is an open-source distributed computing system designed for big data processing and analytics.

**Key Features:**

Distributed Processing: Spark distributes data processing tasks across a cluster of machines for scalability and performance.

In-Memory Computation: Spark utilizes in-memory processing to accelerate data processing compared to disk-based systems.

Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs): Spark's fundamental data structure for fault-tolerant parallel processing.

Spark SQL: Module for working with structured data, including SQL queries and DataFrame APIs.

Machine Learning (MLlib): Library for scalable machine learning algorithms.

Graph Processing (GraphX): Library for graph processing and analytics.

Streaming (Spark Streaming): Module for real-time data processing.



**Databricks:**


Databricks is a unified data analytics platform built on top of Apache Spark, providing an integrated workspace for collaboration, data exploration, and machine learning.

**Key Features:**

Workspace: Collaborative environment for developing Spark applications, notebooks, and visualizations.

Notebooks: Interactive notebooks for exploratory data analysis, visualization, and experimentation.

Clusters: Scalable Spark clusters managed by Databricks for running data processing and machine learning jobs.

Jobs: Scheduled and automated workflows for running Spark jobs on clusters.

Libraries: Centralized management of Spark libraries and dependencies.

Integrated Data Sources: Seamless integration with various data sources such as Amazon S3, Azure Data Lake Storage, and more.

Machine Learning: Built-in support for machine learning workflows using MLflow and other tools.
